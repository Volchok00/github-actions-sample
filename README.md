# deploy-action-test
Temporary repo for testing deploy actions

Contains a barebones Dockerfile which creates a test docker image,
and the [Github Workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml) file which triggers the deployment of this image.

To trigger the build and deployment, create a new release in this repo.
